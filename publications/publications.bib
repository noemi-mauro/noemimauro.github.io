abstract={With the increasing demand for predictable and accountable Artificial Intelligence, the ability to explain or justify recommender systems results by specifying how items are suggested, or why they are relevant, has become a primary goal. However, current models do not explicitly represent the services and actors that the user might encounter during the overall interaction with an item, from its selection to its usage. Thus, they cannot assess their impact on the user’s experience. To address this issue, we propose a novel justification approach that uses service models to (i) extract experience data from reviews concerning all the stages of interaction with items, at different granularity levels, and (ii) organize the justification of recommendations around those stages. In a user study, we compared our approach with baselines reflecting the state of the art in the justification of recommender systems results. The participants evaluated the Perceived User Awareness Support provided by our service-based justification models higher than the one offered by the baselines. Moreover, our models received higher Interface Adequacy and Satisfaction evaluations by users having different levels of Curiosity or low Need for Cognition (NfC). Differently, high NfC participants preferred a direct inspection of item reviews. These findings encourage the adoption of service models to justify recommender systems results but suggest the investigation of personalization strategies to suit diverse interaction needs.},

abstract={Autism is characterized by peculiar sensory processing. The sensory features of a place may have a crucial impact on the decision a person with autism makes when choosing what to visit in a tourist experience. We present a map-based mobile app, conceived for people with mid to high-functioning autism, which exploits sensory features of places to filter the information displayed and suggest locations that may be suitable for their idiosyncratic needs. The mobile app also exploits the crowdmapping paradigm in order to gather these features from the community of users, since they are not publicly available. We describe the results of a composite user evaluation of the app, made up of a task experiment, a field study, and an online questionnaire, which aims to understand (i) whether the explicit presentation of sensory information impacts the decision of going to a specific place, (ii) if the crowdmapping functionality is used and how and (iii) how people with autism navigate the mobile app. The results confirm the importance of the sensory features for people with autism in the decision to go to a specific place. Moreover, they show that crowdmapping may be a good solution to collect such features, but should be integrated with other methods. Finally, the results show that the preferred modality of exploring information about places is by using the map.},

Therefore, recommender systems must deal with these aspects. However, the retrieval of sensory data about PoIs is a real challenge because most geographical information servers fail to provide this data. Moreover, ad-hoc crowdsourcing campaigns do not guarantee to cover large geographical areas and lack sustainability. Thus, we investigate the extraction of sensory data about places from the consumer feedback collected by location-based services, on which people spontaneously post reviews from all over the world. Specifically, we propose a model for the extraction of sensory data from the reviews about PoIs, and its integration in recommender systems to predict item ratings by considering both user preferences and compatibility information. We tested our approach with autistic and neurotypical people by integrating it into diverse recommendation algorithms. For the test, we used a dataset built in a crowdsourcing campaign and another one extracted from TripAdvisor reviews. The results show that the algorithms obtain the highest accuracy and ranking capability when using TripAdvisor data. Moreover, by jointly using these two datasets, the algorithms further improve their performance. These results encourage the use of consumer feedback as a reliable source of information about places in the development of inclusive recommender systems.},

abstract = {Current recommender systems employ item-centric properties to estimate ratings and present the results to the user. However, recent studies highlight the fact that the stages of item fruition also involve extrinsic factors, such as the interaction with the service provider before, during and after item selection. In other words, a holistic view of consumer experience, including local properties of items, as well as consumers’ perceptions of item fruition, should be adopted to enhance user awareness and decision-making. In this work, we integrate recommender systems with service models to reason about the different stages of item fruition. By exploiting the Service Journey Maps to define service-based item and user profiles, we develop a novel family of recommender systems that evaluate items by taking preference management and overall consumer experience into account. Moreover, we introduce a two-level visual model to provide users with different information about recommendation results: (i) the higher level summarizes consumer experience about items and supports the identification of promising suggestions within a possibly long list of results; (ii) the lower level enables the exploration of detailed data about the local properties of items. In a user test instantiated in the home-booking domain, we compared our models to standard recommender systems. We found that the service-based algorithms that only use item fruition experience excel in ranking and minimize the error in rating estimation. Moreover, the combination of data about item fruition experience and item properties achieves slightly lower recommendation performance; however, it enhances users’ perceptions of the awareness and the decision-making support provided by the system. These results encourage the adoption of service-based models to summarize user preferences and experience in recommender systems.},

abstract = {The suggestion of Points of Interest (PoIs) to people with autism spectrum disorders challenges the research about recommender systems by introducing an explicit need to consider both user preferences and aversions in item evaluation. The reason is that autistic users' perception of places is influenced by sensory aversions, which can cause stress and anxiety when they visit the suggested PoIs. Therefore, the management of individual preferences is not enough to provide these people with suitable recommendations.To address this issue, we propose a Top-N recommendation model that combines information about the user's idiosyncratic aversions with her/his preferences in a personalized way. The goal is that of suggesting the places that (s)he can like and smoothly experience at the same time. We are interested in finding a user-specific balance of compatibility and interest within a recommendation model that integrates heterogeneous evaluation criteria to appropriately take these aspects into account.We tested our model on 148 adults, 20 of which were people with autism spectrum disorders. The evaluation results show that, on both groups, our model achieves superior accuracy and ranking results than the recommender systems based on item compatibility, on user preferences, or which integrate these aspects using a uniform evaluation model. These findings encourage us to use our model as a basis for the development of inclusive recommender systems.},

Moreover, stories could be associated through their common themes. Thus, a focus on individual narrations is not enough to provide users with a holistic view of the places they visit. In this paper, we investigate the presentation of interlaced Cultural Heritage information to make users aware about the connections among such stories. For this purpose, we propose an exploration model that enables the user to take side walks in semantically-related narrations concerning Points of Interest. This is based on a semantic knowledge representation where two types of relations connect entities within individual stories, and stories through their common themes. Based on this representation, we developed the Triangolazioni mobile guide that presents multimedia information about Cultural Heritage in Torino city. A user study has shown that participants perceived the app, and its ”side walking” support, as highly usable. Moreover, they appreciated the storytelling capabilities of the app.},

In recent years we observed increased interest in session-based recommendation scenarios, where the problem is to make item suggestions to users based only on interactions observed in an ongoing session, e.g., on an e-commerce site. However, in cases where interactions from previous user sessions are also available, the recommendations can be personalized according to the users’ long-term preferences, a process called session-aware recommendation. Today, research in this area is scattered, and many works only compare a newly proposed session-aware with existing session-based models. This makes it challenging to understand what represents the state-of-the-art. To close this research gap, we benchmarked recent session-aware algorithms against each other and against a number of session-based recommendation algorithms along with heuristic extensions thereof. Our comparison, to some surprise, revealed that (i) simple techniques based on nearest neighbors consistently outperform recent neural techniques and that (ii) session-aware models were mostly not better than approaches that do not use long-term preference information. Our work therefore points to potential methodological issues where new methods are compared to weak baselines, and it also indicates that there remains a huge potential for more sophisticated session-aware recommendation algorithms.}

In this paper we investigate the role of deviations in the properties of reviews as helpfulness determinants with the intuition that “out of the core” feedback helps item evaluation. We propose a novel helpfulness estimation model that extends previous ones with the analysis of deviations in rating, length and polarity with respect to the reviews written by the same person, or concerning the same item. A regression analysis carried out on two large datasets of reviews extracted from Yelp social network shows that user-based deviations in review length and rating clearly influence perceived helpfulness. Moreover, an experiment on the same datasets shows that the integration of our helpfulness estimation model improves the performance of a collaborative recommender system by enhancing the selection of high-quality data for rating estimation. Our model is thus an effective tool to select relevant user feedback for decision-making.}

In recent years, the class of session-based recommendation algorithms received more attention in the research literature. These algorithms base their recommendations solely on the observed interactions with the user in an ongoing session and do not require the existence of long-term preference profiles. Most recently, a number of deep learning-based (“neural”) approaches to session-based recommendations have been proposed. However, previous research indicates that today’s complex neural recommendation methods are not always better than comparably simple algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy. With this work, our goal is to shed light on the state of the art in the area of session-based recommendation and on the progress that is made with neural approaches. For this purpose, we compare twelve algorithmic approaches, among them six recent neural methods, under identical conditions on various datasets. We find that the progress in terms of prediction accuracy that is achieved with neural methods is still limited. In most cases, our experiments show that simple heuristic methods based on nearest-neighbors schemes are preferable over conceptually and computationally more complex methods. Observations from a user study furthermore indicate that recommendations based on heuristic methods were also well accepted by the study participants. To support future progress and reproducibility in this area, we publicly share the SESSION-REC evaluation framework that was used in our research.}

abstract={In the selection of products or services, overviewing the list of options to identify the most promising ones is key to decision-making. However, current models for the justification of recommender systems results poorly support this task because, as they exclusively focus on item properties, they generate detailed justifications that are lengthy to skim. Moreover, they overlook the existence of a complex item fruition process which can impact customer satisfaction as well. For instance, consumer feedback shows that relevant factors in home booking include both the properties of apartments, and previous customers' perceptions of the interaction with the personnel who manages the homes. To address this issue, we propose a visual model that exploits an explicit representation of the service underlying item fruition to generate a high-level, holistic summary of previous consumers' opinions about the suggested items. From this overview, the user can identify the relevant items and retrieve detailed information about them, in a selective way, thus reducing information load. Our model is instantiated on the Airbnb experiences domain and uses the Service Blueprints to identify evaluation dimensions for the incremental presentation of data about items. A preliminary user study has shown that our model supports user awareness about items by enabling people to quickly filter out the unsuitable recommendations, so that they can analyze in detail the most relevant options.},

On the one hand, a model-based description that clarifies the reasoning approach behind the suggestions might be difficult to understand, or it might fail to convince the user, if (s)he does not agree on the applied inference mechanism. On the other hand, an aspect-based justification based on few characteristics might provide a partial view of items or, if more detailed, it might overload the user with too much information. In order to address these issues, we propose a visual model aimed at justifying recommendations from a holistic perspective. Our model is based on a service-oriented summary of consumers’ experience with items. We use the Service Journey Maps to extract data about the experience with services from online reviews, and to generate a visual summary of such feedback, based on evaluation dimensions that refer to all the stages of service fruition. Thanks to a graphical representation of these dimensions (based on bar graphs), and on the provision of on-demand data about the associated aspects of items, our model enables the user to overview the recommendation list and to quickly identify the subset of results that deserve to be inspected in detail for a final selection decision. A preliminary user study, based on the Apartment Monitoring application, has provided encouraging results about the usefulness and efficacy of our model to enhance user awareness and decision-making in the presence of medium-size recommendation lists.},

However, the increasing diffusion of informal activities and events, supported by location-based services such as Airbnb, extends personalized recommendation to a many-to-one match-making task. Airbnb experiences, which any citizen can propose to offer geographic tours and thematic activities, are composed of at least two entities to be evaluated: the former is the experience itself (in terms of topic, cost, etc.); the latter is the host, who directly interacts with guests during the management of the planned activities. As both entities can dramatically influence guests’ perceptions, they should be jointly taken into account by recommender systems.

  abstract = {Inclusive recommender systems should take both user preferences and the compatibility of items with the user into account in order to generate suggestions that can be appreciated and smoothly experienced at the same time. For instance, considering people in the Autism Spectrum Disorder, the sensory features of a place that is potentially interesting to the user are important to predict whether it might make her/him uncomfortable when visiting it. However, information about users’ experience with items can
hardly be found in the metadata provided by online geographic sources.
In order to address this issue, we suggest to retrieve it from the consumer feedback collected by location-based services that publish item reviews. This type of feedback represents a sustainable information source because it is supported by people through a continuous reviewing activity. Thus, it deserves special attention as a potential data source. In this paper, we outline how this type of information can be retrieved and we discuss its benefits to Top-N recommendation of Points of Interest.

However, they are challenged by recent studies according to which people generally perceive the usage of data about social relations as a violation of their own privacy. In order to address this issue, we extend trust-based recommender systems with additional evidence about trust, based on public anonymous information, and we make them configurable with respect to the data that can be used in the given application domain: 1. We propose the Multi-faceted Trust Model (MTM) to define trust among users in a compositional way, possibly including or excluding the types of information it contains. MTM flexibly integrates social links with public anonymous feedback received by user profiles and user contributions in social networks. 2. We propose LOCABAL+, based on MTM, which extends the LOCABAL trust-based recommender system with multi-faceted trust and trust-based social regularization. Experiments carried out on two public datasets of item reviews show that, with a minor loss of user coverage, LOCABAL+ outperforms state-of-the art trust-based recommender systems and Collaborative Filtering in accuracy, ranking of items and error minimization both when it uses complete information about trust and when it ignores social relations. The combination of MTM with LOCABAL+ thus represents a promising alternative to state-of-the-art trust-based recommender systems.}

INTEREST is based on the Service Journey Maps for the design and description of user experience with services. We applied it to the home booking domain by developing the Apartment Monitoring application that supports overviewing and analyzing online reviews about rented homes. In a user study, we compared the decision-making support provided by our application with that of a baseline model that enables a temporal filtering of consumer feedback. We found out that Apartment Monitoring outperforms the baseline in user experience, user awareness of item properties, and user control during the interaction with the system. In particular, according to the participants of the study, Apartment Monitoring describes the expectations about the homes and it supports their selection in a more effective way than the baseline. These findings encourage moving from a low-level description of item properties to a service-oriented one in order to improve users’ decision-making capabilities."

In order to address this issue, we propose a Top-N recommendation model that combines the user's idiosyncratic aversions with her/his preferences in a personalized way to suggest the most compatible and likable Points of Interest for her/him.

We tested our model on both ASD and "neurotypical" people.

However, most works focus on the inspection of a single type of information, e.g., hotels or music. In contrast, CH items are heterogeneous: they include natural and artificial monuments and different types of artworks which might be visited within a single tour. Moreover, CH sites are often visited in group, thus raising the expectation that all the involved people share information and decisions about what to do.In order to address this issue, we propose a map-based faceted exploration model that makes it possible to create custom, long-lasting maps representing a shared information space for user collaboration, and temporally project these maps on the basis of fine-grained filters which help users focus on items associated to short-term, specific interests. Our model supports the user in the organization and filtering of CH information on the basis of multiple perspectives related to the attributes of items. We propose graphical widgets to support interactive data visualization, faceted exploration, category-based information hiding and transparency of results at the same time. The widgets are based on the sunburst diagram, which compactly displays visualization criteria on data categories by showing facets and facet values in a circular structure.},

However, today's research practice in applied machine learning---where researchers often use a variety of baselines, datasets, and evaluation procedures---can make it difficult to understand how much progress is actually achieved through novel technical approaches. In this work, we focus on the fast-developing area of session-based recommendation and aim to contribute to a better understanding of what represents the state-of-the-art.To that purpose, we have conducted an extensive set of experiments, using a variety of datasets, in which we benchmarked four neural approaches that were published in the last three years against each other and against a set of simpler baseline techniques, e.g., based on nearest neighbors. The evaluation of the algorithms under the exact same conditions revealed that the benefits of applying today's neural approaches to session-based recommendations are still limited. In the majority of the cases, and in particular when precision and recall are used, it turned out that simple techniques in most cases outperform recent neural approaches. Our findings therefore point to certain major limitations of today's research practice. By sharing our evaluation framework publicly, we hope that some of these limitations can be overcome in the future.},

However, they focus on explicit relations between users and they leave out other types of information that can contribute to determine users' global reputation; e.g., public recognition of reviewers' quality.We are interested in understanding if and when these additional types of feedback improve Top-N recommendation. For this purpose, we propose a multi-faceted trust model to integrate local trust, represented by social links, with various types of global trust evidence provided by social networks. We aim at identifying general classes of data in order to make our model applicable to different case studies. Then, we test the model by applying it to a variant of User-to-User Collaborative filtering (U2UCF) which supports the fusion of rating similarity, local trust derived from social relations, and multi-faceted reputation for rating prediction.We test our model on two datasets: the Yelp one publishes generic friend relations between users but provides different types of trust feedback, including user profile endorsements. The LibraryThing dataset offers fewer types of feedback but it provides more selective friend relations aimed at content sharing. The results of our experiments show that, on the Yelp dataset, our model outperforms both U2UCF and state-of-the-art trust-based recommenders that only use rating similarity and social relations. Differently, in the LibraryThing dataset, the combination of social relations and rating similarity achieves the best results. The lesson we learn is that multi-faceted trust can be a valuable type of information for recommendation. However, before using it in an application domain, an analysis of the type and amount of available trust evidence has to be done to assess its real impact on recommendation performance.},

In this work, we are interested in evaluating whether other sources of preference information than ratings and social ties can be used to improve recommendation performance. Specifically, we aim at testing whether the integration of frequently co-occurring interests in information search logs can improve recommendation performance in User-to-User Collaborative Filtering (U2UCF). For this purpose, we propose the Extended Category-based Collaborative Filtering (ECCF) recommender, which enriches category-based user profiles derived from the analysis of rating behavior with data categories that are frequently searched together by people in search sessions. We test our model using a big rating dataset and a log of a largely used search engine to extract the co-occurrence of interests. The experiments show that ECCF outperforms U2UCF and category-based collaborative recommendation in accuracy, MRR, diversity of recommendations and user coverage. Moreover, it outperforms the SVD++ Matrix Factorization algorithm in accuracy and diversity of recommendation lists.},

However, in order to cope with possibly heterogeneous user interests, they should be adapted to the individual user by including the relevant types of information, given her/his specific interests. In a previous paper, we proposed an approach to the integration of thematic maps in the OnToMap Participatory GIS (Geographic Information System), in order to support query expansion during an exploratory search task. The proposed maps were built on the basis of a survey in which we asked people to rate the relevance of a set of concepts to five main themes around which we developed the maps. In this paper we go one step forward and we propose a more general approach to information search support in order to automatically create thematic maps, based on the analysis of frequently co-occurring search interests in a search engine query log. This type of analysis supports the identification of clusters of concepts that people frequently search within the same sessions and helps the identification of co-occurring topics that can be proposed to users when exploring an information space. In this way, when the user browses a catalog of Cultural Heritage information, (s)he can both visualize the thematic maps relevant to the search context, and be guided in the navigation within types of information, looking for possibly complementary types of data to satisfy her/his needs.},

We study how different levels of detail in knowledge representation influence the capability of guiding the user in the exploration of a complex information space. A comparative analysis of the performance of a query expansion model, using three spatial ontologies defined at different semantic granularity levels, reveals that a fine-grained representation enhances recall. However, precision depends on how closely the ontologies match the way people conceptualize and verbally describe the geographic space.}

Moreover, the model supports interactive information filtering in the map by enabling the user to focus on different data categories, using transparency sliders to tune the opacity, and thus the emphasis, of the corresponding data items. A test with users provided positive results concerning the efficacy of the model.},

Moreover, complex information spaces, such as those managed by Geographical Information Systems, can disorient people, making it difficult to find relevant data. In order to address these issues, we developed a session-based suggestion model that proposes concepts as a em "you might also be interested in»» function, by taking the user»s previous queries into account. Our model can be applied to incrementally generate suggestions in interactive search. It can be used for query expansion, and in general to guide users in the exploration of possibly complex spaces of data categories. Our model is based on a concept co-occurrence graph that describes how frequently concepts are searched together in search sessions. Starting from an ontological domain representation, we generated the graph by analyzing the query log of a major search engine. Moreover, we identified clusters of ontology concepts which frequently co-occur in the sessions of the log via community detection on the graph. The evaluation of our model provided satisfactory accuracy results.},

    abstract = {Abstract: With the convergence of geographical information systems (GIS) and internet technology, the public administration is starting to use online maps as a web-based bidirectional communication channel with the population: maps are used: i) in public portals, for publishing and crowdsourcing information about the territory; ii) in policy-making, for defining a community vision of the territory and for involving people in public choices. Both cases raise challenges related to the large amount of data handled in the maps, and to their lack of group collaboration support. We attempted to address these issues by developing an information-sharing model, and a testbed software application, that support group management and the generation of persistent, custom community maps focused on the user's interests. Our model builds on tag-based user profiles and on information filtering. This paper describes our model and the results of an evaluation of the GroupMapping application, based on it.}

abstract = {Textual queries are largely employed in information retrieval to let users specify search goals in a natural way. However, differences in user and system terminologies can challenge the identification of the user's information needs, and thus the generation of relevant results. We argue that the explicit management of ontological knowledge, and of the meaning of concepts (by integrating linguistic and encyclopaedic knowledge in the system ontology), can improve the analysis of search queries, because it enables a flexible identification of the topics the user is searching for, regardless of the adopted vocabulary. This paper proposes an information retrieval support model based on semantic concept identification. Starting from the recognition of the ontology concepts that the search query refers to, this model exploits the qualifiers specified in the query to select information items on the basis of possibly fine-grained features. Moreover, it supports query expansion and reformulation by suggesting the exploration of semantically similar concepts, as well as of concepts related to those referred in the query through thematic relations. A test on a data-set collected using the OnToMap Participatory GIS has shown that this approach provides accurate results.},

In the project I analyze two methodologies to offer personalized search results in community maps and a natural interaction with the system. The first consists of automatically gathering the users interests at a concept level in order to generate clusters of concepts useful for the presentation of thematic maps. This is done by creating ontology-based user models mapped to the domain ontology adopted by the PGIS. The second concerns the creation of content-based user models useful for filtering the items belonging to each concept in a multifaceted way: the goal is that of reducing and adapting the information space presented in the map. In the project I also analyze how these techniques may be jointly used during the query expansion process to retrieve more accurate and relevant search results.}
